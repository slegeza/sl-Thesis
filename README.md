#sl-Thesis

Welcome to my thesis! Here you will find some of the Notebooks containing data analyzed about the globular cluster NGC 6266.  Notably, you'll find how we calculated
our color-magnitude diagrams, and how we located candidates near an x-ray source and identified x-ray emitters where possible.  Regrettably, the file
containing the total analysis is too big to upload directly to GitHub, but the thesis itself contains this information as well.
